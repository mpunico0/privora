        <h1>Author's Thoughts</h1>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPrivora started out as a project as a requirement for Empowerment Technologies. It allowed us to have a platform about something we truly cared about. It was a great project, especially to intelligent students who have an interest in technology. It fostered teamwork and collaboration, everyone had to contribute for the good of the advocacy, and it strengthened our skills in copywriting, designing, web development, and video editing. It allowed students to contribute and make an impact towards society, despite having little power to do so. </p>
	<p><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAt first, I believed that creating an advocacy was an easy task. We were already so used to designing, researching, and editing our projects from prior years. However, it slowly proved me wrong. An advocacy page does not end as soon as you click “Upload”, it is more than that. You need to watch analytics, to see what’s doing well and what isn’t, to see what your audience wants from likes, comments, and shares, to adapt your content to what’s popular, and all that while maintaining your time for other subjects and personal life. It can be quite draining, especially in the first few weeks where we aimed to grow quick. It was difficult, we were not getting the likes and follows that we expected. We had to mass share our page, and yet that was nearly not enough. But when our numbers slowly started increasing, it felt great. Finally, our hard work was paying off. It felt great seeing something that you’re very passionate about spread to hundreds, even thousands of people.</p>
	<p><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe advocacy journey certainly isn’t easy, but I’d say it is fulfilling to bring positive change towards society. My message to those who wish to start an advocacy is to start now. The sooner your advocacy gets to the public, the better! With just some computers and a couple great minds, you can give birth to something that will change lives. </p>
